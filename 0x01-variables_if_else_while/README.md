0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while is the name of a project or module in the curriculum of the Low-Level Programming track at Holberton School. In this project, students learn about the basics of the C programming language, including:

Variables: declaration, initialization, and assignment
Data types: int, char, float, double, void
Operators: arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators
Control flow statements: if, else, and while statements
Boolean expressions and conditional statements
Loops: while and do-while loops
ASCII and character encoding
The project consists of a series of exercises and assignments that gradually increase in complexity and provide students with opportunities to practice their skills and reinforce their understanding of the concepts covered in the project. By the end of this project, students should have a solid foundation in C programming and be able to write simple programs using variables, control flow statements, and loops.
